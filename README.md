# PDW (Product Web Scraper) - [0.0.1]
## Steps:

- First clone the repository, enter it and then type on the console: `npm i`
- After that set the enviroment variables, also called `.env` with the DATABASE_URL and the PORT

## Observations:
- It is not completed, so not every URL will work (like a product from Nike for example)
- It doesn't have a documentation, so by now just explore the project and have fun!

## Future updates:
- [+] Add more domains to the scraper, so in the future can be used in a lot of situations
- [-] Fix some nomenclatures and refactor the code
